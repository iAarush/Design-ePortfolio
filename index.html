  <h1>What is food waste?</h1>
<p>Food waste is the name given to food that is not consumed and thrown away instead. It can come from kitchens, homes, cafeterias, and other places. Different places will have different  sources of food waste- for example, a school cafeteria will produce different types of waste as compared to a home kitchen or an office worker.</p>
  <h1>The 5Ws of this problem</h1>
  <h2>What is the problem?</h2>
  <p>The problem is food waste and this is seen in many ways. Specific to Oakridge International School (my client), the problems seen are as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Food waste is mainly produced in the cafeteria.</li>
    <li>There is no existing comprehensive solution to food waste at school- there have been attempts at composting, but there is a lack of student awareness and engagement.</li>
    <li>Food waste produced within classrooms and by students opting for home lunches is minimal and usually gets taken back to the home. As a result, it is a difficult problem to address.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Why and how is this a problem?</h2>
  <p>Food waste is a problem at our school for 2 main reasons, just like in most other parts of the world. They are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Overconsumption: Students pick up more food than they can eat, and this food can't be returned for hygiene reasons. As a result, it is thrown away.</li>
    <li>No reusing: Although stopping overconsumption will reduce food waste, some waste is inevitable. However, all food waste produced is simply thrown into the trash. This can be avoided because food waste can be reused in mutliple ways, such as composting or converting into biogas.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now that we know the causes of the problem, we need to understand what the problem really is. Some people say that wasting food is a crime because today's food system is inefficient and fosters inequalities </p>
  <p>Supermarkets in North America and Europe, for example, are stocked with a variety of foods that are often never sold and thrown away after their expiry dates. Customers buy more food than they can consume at these stores, and throw wasted food out at their homes because it spoils quickly after being cooked. At the same time, people in developing nations such as those in Sub-Saharan Africa have to deal with hunger and frequent famines. <strong>When there is enough food to feed everyone on the planet, why is food not given to everyone on the planet?</strong></p>
  <p>There is another perspective to the issue of food waste. This is that food, when thrown out, decomposes ineffectively and produces large amounts of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Nitrogen and hydrogen sulfide are other gases that are also produced when organic matter (including food) decomposes.</p>
  <p>Lastly, it is important to realize that all of this can be avoided not only by reducing overconsumption, but by reusing and treating organic food waste instead of throwing it out- such as by composting, creating biogas, or turning food waste into animal feed. At Oakridge International School, my solution is helping to compost and create biogas that can be used for energy (cooking).</p>
  <h2>Where is it a problem? Who does it affect?</h2>
  <p>Food waste is, understandably, a problem all over the world. Here are the ways it can be a problem for different communities and societies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Households: Within households, the accumulation of food waste can lead to pests such as houseflys, fungi, and more. These can pose health concerns for all people living at home. Young children and senior citizens are especially vulnerable.</li>
    <li>Schools: The accumulation of food waste at schools is a problem similar to that at home, but on a larger scale. Because of a high amount of students producing a larger amount of waste, effective waste management is required at schools. This can become expensive, and, unfortunately, food waste is usually treated like normal waste and leads to carbon emissions.</li>
    <li>Businesses: Waste is produced in many ways by different businesses. Almost all businesses have to deal with food waste, from startups to restaurants. However, the scale of the problem varies based on a lot of factors such as the nature of the business and the number of employees. In general, the main problem food waste causes for businesses is pollution in the local area and the financial cost of waste management (especially for large businesses).</li>
    <li>Nationally: For national governments, food waste is a major part of national waste produced. This is especially true for developed countries, where overconsumption is a major issue. The main problems national governments face as a result of food waste are issues with drafting and enforcing regulation to limit food waste and ensure that it is treated effectively, and balancing these requirements with their existing budgets and other commitments. </li>
    <li>Internationally: Internationally, food waste is a major problem that requires the cooperation of all nations, organizations, and world citizens. Higher amounts of food waste are produced in developed countries, but food waste releases greenhouse gases that disproportionately affect developing countries. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>When did it become a problem?</h2>
   <p>Of course, food waste has been produced for as long as humans have eaten. However, in pre-Industrial times, it was produced at a much lower rate because people did not overconsume and the population was lower. It has become an internaitonal problem in the past few decades, meaning it is a relatively new problem. As a result, it is important to ensure that we solve it before it grows into something uncontrollable. </p>
